Project uses dialog command to guide the user. First, user must access to his account. If user doesn't have an account, a new account must be created. After accessing the account, user can choose to either write an entry for today or write&edit&read an entry for a given day. Entry name format will be "day"-"month"-"year"-Journal.txt

Entries are kept in a zip file that is named "accountname".zip. Zip file is protected with user's password. Zip file is essencial for accessing user's account. Before using the script, be sure there aren't any entries outside of the zip files; or else they will be deleted.

Warning:
Do not rename your zip file. If you do, change it back to "accountname".zip.
Entry protection is done by zip password protection, so protection is not the most realiable.
